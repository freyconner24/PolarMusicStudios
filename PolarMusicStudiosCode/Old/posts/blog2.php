					<p>I accepted USC without ever having seen the campus... so I must admit, I was really nervous for orientation.  My friend Derek and I got up at 4:30am in order to make sure that we got to campus on time for our 7:00am orientation.  Needless to say, we got there much earlier than expected which meant that I got to take some pictures at sunrise!  Here is Derek and a fountain (:</p>

					<p>Since these are landscape photos, I made sure to take them at <i>f/8.0</i>.  I used a fast shutter speed so that the exposure was centered around the sky.  I didn't want to clip any of the whites and I shot on RAW so that I could easily bring back the shadows of the foreground.</p>

					<p>After orientation picked up, we went on our first campus tour and we were taken to the Viterbi Engineering school!</p>

					<p>After a long day of walking and registering for our classes, Derek and I decided to sit and chill by one of the fountains.</p>

					<p>After some rest it was off to the cinema school to poke around!  I must say it was quite amazing.  We saw the Steven Spielberg Building, the statue of Douglas Fairbanks, and a bunch of really cool old cameras.</p>

					<p>All in all, I had a great day and I met a lot of interesting people.  The campus was beautiful, Los Angeles will keep me on my toes, and I can't wait to take advantage of the artistically oriented Computer Science program at USC. -CF</p>
