			<div class="row"><div class="text">If you want to be featured on Polar Music Studios, it's easy!  Just send me some links to your stuff so I can see what I'm working with and we can talk about putting you on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PolarMusicStudios" style="color: #555;">Polar Music Studios</a> YouTube channel.  Oh yea, and did I mention it's totally free?  All I ask is that you get a few of your friends (5 - 10) to subscribe to Polar Music Studios and when the video is finished, you give me a huge shout out over your favorite social media platforms.</div></div>

			<div class="row"><div class="text">If you want to help boost your own channel, I'm going to need some dough ;D.  The price will depend on how many people/instruments are in the shoot as well as where I need to go for the shoot.  However, there are a few ways to cheapen the price!  If you let my logos be in your video I will knock off $20 and if you can get 25 of your friends and family to subscribe to Polar Music Studios and have a few of them give me some shoutouts on social media, I can knock off an aditional $20.  Let's make some videos!</div></div>

			<div class="row"><div class="text">I have shot various events over my videography career and I really enjoy it!  The price is pretty self explanatory, but I am down to work with you on pricing if the events is really long.  Also, if you want the video edited, I will tack on an additional $50 - $100 fee depending on the depth of editing.</div></div>

			<div class="row"><div class="text">I love working with singer songwriters &mdash; in fact, it's kind of my bread and butter!  The price is $140 a song which includes all recording and mixing, no matter how long it takes!  However, this price can be reduced through various types of social media shoutouts as well.  For some examples of my production quality, just check out Chasing Nora's first EP, <a href="http://chasingnora.bandcamp.com" style="color: #555;">"For Want of a Letter EP"</a>.  It was completely mixed and mastered with Polar Music Studios' setup.</div></div>

			<div class="row"><div class="sub-title">BAND RECORDING: $100 + $50 / INSTRUMENT</div></div>
			<div class="row"><div class="text">Recording a band takes a lot more work than a single singer songwriter setup, so I decided to tack on an extra $50 per instrument.  There is a lot more to deal with while recording recording a full band and mixing tends to take a lot longer with each additional instrument.  But I am up for the challenge and I am interested in recording your songs!</div></div>

			<div class="row"><div class="text">So this might seem like a cop-out fee, but a lot of people like to take the mixes and  send them to big record labels to master so that they can put a big name in their production credits (I'm talking Abbey Roads big, people).  For that matter, I decided to charge separately for mastering since many people may only want the mix.</div></div>

I have shot various events for the UC Davis College of Engineering as well as some birthdays and parties.  If you would like the photos to be edited by me, I'll tack on an extra $60 editing fee.  At the end of the day, you will get all of the pictures regardless of whether you want them edited or unedited!</div></div>

The best way for us to go about this one is to meet up in person (or emial trail if you prefer) in order to work out the detials of what you want.  From there, I can give you a quote!

			<div class="row"><div class="text">
				<p>I started producing music and music videos for my band in high school and I have been creating content ever since.  When college hit, I continued to follow my passion for multi-media through Polar Music Studios and Chasing Nora.</p>
				<p>After a few interviews and some luck, my work for Polar Music Studios helped me a land a job running the YouTube channel for the College of Engineering at UC Davis.  For two years, I worked in a highly professional setting with high quality video and audio equipment.  Since I knew how to record music, I also produced all of the backing tracks.</p>
				<p>After two years at UC Davis, I transfered to USC where I currently work as a campus web developer and produce content for Polar Music Studios on the side.</p>
				<p>Although I do a lot of video and music production, I am actually pursuing a degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in Web Technologies and Applications. Web Development and graphic design is a huge passion of mine.  In fact, the website that you are using right now was developed by me, completely from scratch!  That means I "hardcoded" the entire website without using any 3rd party helpers.  And the best part is that I enjoy it (:</p>

			<div class="row"><div class="text">
				<p>I love what I do and I always try to churn out the best content that I can.  That means late nights, large investments in my own equipment, and a diligent work ethic to complete projects.</p>
				<p>All throughout my life I have been creating projects and pushing multi-media content of my own and I am really looking forward to sharing my technical skills with artists that are ballin' on a budget.  I have the utmost appreciation for the arts and I believe that good content should be shown to the world.  Trust me, if money is an issue, we will think of alternatives and get your stuff out there.</p>
				<p>Ultimately, I love a challenge and trying new things because it forces me to think on my feet and further my skills.  I am basically up for any project!  Seriously, just email/message me.</p>

				<p>All in all, I am looking forward to meeting new people and working with more artists.  If I can give any consolation concerning my personality or collaboration skillz, I have been told on many occaisions that I am fun to work with, respectful, encouraging, and I have been complimented on the fact that I "can tell a good take from a bad take".  I am looking forward to meeting you!
