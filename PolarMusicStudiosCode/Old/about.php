						<h4 class="my-h4 my-title">What Is Polar Music Studios?</h4>
						<p>Polar Music Studios is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1vJTvUDmBuOp82kBUtf6-Q">YouTube</a> channel that I started a few years back.  I wanted to get a fresh start from my old YouTube channel (not to be named...)&#8212;a channel where I would post covers of super awesome metal and post-hardcore songs.  I started getting really into the acoustic Indie scene and I felt I was ready to put my time into a different genre.  I initially started to post some acoustic covers and a few of my original songs written in high school.  As I continued to learn about music production and making videos, I started to notice that a few tutorials that I thought would be useful were missing from the internet.  So, with a handful of crudely recorded covers and originals and one oddly successful Logic Pro 9 tutorial, Polar Music Studios took its first breath of life.</p>
						<p>I went to the University of California, Davis in the fall of 2012 and started meeting some other musicians who were interested in making covers and writing music.  It took me about six months of recording and prodicing live music videos before I realized what I wanted Polar Music Studios to be.</p>
						<p>I am not interested in making a fleet of viral music videos like Pentatonix and Gabe Bondoc.  Nor am I looking to form a coalition of extremely talented artists like Kurt Hugo Schneider and Sam Sui.  I want to promote talented, fledgling artists who are interested in getting their music out there, but don't have good video and/or recording equipment.  I want to produce live acoustic videos for them so that they can share the video with their friends, family, and potential fans.  Oh yea, and did I mention that I am going to do it for free?</p>
						<p>So here is the bottom line.  If you want me to make a video of you, your band, or your friend's band, subscribe to my channel, and send me a message through the "Contact Me" link at the top.  We'll set up a date and have a wonderful afternoon of recording music and making videos (: Here are some videos of my friends:</p>

						<h4 class="my-h4 my-title">Who Runs This Whole Thing?</h4>
						<p>My name is Conner Frey and I am currently a third-year Computer Science Major at the University of Southern California.  After some introspection, I decided to transfer to USC from UC Davis in order to chase a slightly more artistic Computer Science degree.  In addition to the CS major, I hope to complete a double minor in Web Develpment and Music Recording.</p>
						<p>I love all things musical and my interests range far and wide.  I enjoy listening to stripped down indie music as well as screamo and pst hardcore.  I will always have a soft spot for Underoath's <i>They're Only Chasing Safety</i> and Killswitch Engage's <i>As Daylight Dies</i>.  Pensive rap set off the lyrical-genius-ometer in my head and hard dubstep drops spark the same emotions that I get from a good post-hardcore breakdown.  Here are some videos of me:</p>
