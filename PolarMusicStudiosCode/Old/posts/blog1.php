					<p>I don't really know what it is about the hills, but it seems to be where my friends and I always end up.  I had never watched 4th of July fireworks from up high until this year and I must say that it was absolutely breathtaking.  We got to see everyone's show&#8212;the legal and the illegal ;D&#8212;and both were quite entertaining.  Naturally, I brought my Canon DSLR with me to document the night and try my hand at some long exposure shots.  Here are two of my favorite firework shots below!</p>

					<p>Although I enjoy photography, audio seems to always come first to my brain.  I could not get over the SOUNDS above the city!  There were explosions left and right, car alarms blaring near and far, and cop sirens wailing everywhere.  It was great.  A myriad of sounds blended together to create a city soundtrack.  A wonderful cacophony.  It's times like these when I wish I brought my mic...</p>

					<p>After obsessing over the fireworks with my 50mm f1.4, I decided to get some wider shots of the city with my wide angle, 24-105.  These two shots ended up being my favorites.  They were both shot closed at f8.0 and exposed for about 30 seconds.  It took a little while to get a smooth picture, but I soon got the hang of it.  And I must say, I am quite satisfied with the results.  I think my favorite one is getting the car streaks, the airplane, and the firework all in the frame at the same time.  It looks pretty damn cool if I do say so myself (:</p>

					<p>After about three hours of staying up in the hills my friends and I decided to head down and play zombie tag at a nearby school.  It felt pretty cool because fireworks were exploding all around us as we were running around and climbing rooftops.  Needless to say, the East Side of San Jose definitely has its gems.  -CF</p>
